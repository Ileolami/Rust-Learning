# **Variable**

1. It assign data to a temporary memory location. It allows programmer to easily work with memory.
2. It can be set to any value and type.
3. They are immutable by default but can be mutable using the keyword `mut`.

 Immutable: cannot be change.
 Mutable: can be changed.

For example:

```rust
let hello = "hello"; // Let is keyword use for creating varibale, hello is the variable name, = to assign a varible, "hello" data assign to the variable
const number = 3;

let mut my_name = "Bill"; // mut keyword mean my_name data can be changed later. 

let quit = false;
```
